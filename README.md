# Project 03 - Community Detection

## Overview

Community detection in networks is a popular area of graph theory.  The Girvan-Newman algorithm is a relatively new option for performing community detection in networks/graphs.  

This project implements the Girvan-Newman algorithm using the Boost Graph Library tp detect sub communities within a given graph.  You can find more about Girvan-Newman in the original paper and also some other resources:

## Requirements 
Input file containing the data for the graph to be worked on, in the format demonstrated below in the example network input.

This project also requires two arguments to run:
  1. input file name
  2. output file Name

## Output
Outputs the communities detected into a separate file specified by the secound arguments given to the program. 
Each community should have a heading `Community X` followed by a list of nodes that are part of that community each on a separate line. 

You can use the [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/), a Python network analysis library to generate graphs to use for testing.  Take a look at the Graph Generator functionality here The library also has 4 social network graphs already included.  You'll just need to write them out to a file in the format below so your program can read them. 

Example network input:

```text
7
A - C
B - C
C - D
D - E
D - F
G - A
G - B
```
NOTE: Verticies Must be named (A....Z) and the first line should be the number of edges
Example network output:

```text
Community 0
 A
 B
 C
 G

Community 1
 D
 E
 F
```
